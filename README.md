# Jiwar Database

Jiwar database is an open-source neighborhood database covering 40 languages. It provides three types of neighborhood information (orthographic, phonological, phonographic) for 10k-30k words per language.

## Features

- üó£Ô∏è Supports 40 languages
- üìÅ Available in:
  - [TSV](https://github.com/AlaaAlzahrani/Jiwar_database/tree/master/jiwar_database/tsv)
  - [CSV](https://github.com/AlaaAlzahrani/Jiwar_database/tree/master/jiwar_database/csv)
  - [XLSX](https://github.com/AlaaAlzahrani/Jiwar_database/tree/master/jiwar_database/xlsx)
  - [TXT](https://github.com/AlaaAlzahrani/Jiwar_database/tree/master/jiwar_database/txt)

## How to Use

1. **Navigate**: go to the [jiwar_database](https://github.com/AlaaAlzahrani/Jiwar_database/tree/master/jiwar_database) directory.

2. **Obtain**: download the file for the language and format you need.

3. **Query**: we recommend using the database in Excel format as it allows for fast and robust queries.

## File Naming

Files in the database are named using [ISO language codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) (e.g., 'ar' for Arabic, 'fr' for French).

## Language Not Listed?

If your language isn't listed, you can use the [Jiwar Calculator](https://github.com/AlaaAlzahrani/Jiwar) to generate neighborhood measures for words in 90 additional language varieties.
